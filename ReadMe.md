This project is based on the Micrograd project by Andrej Karpathy
The goal of this project is to understand the basic idea of back propagation.

File Structure:
1. engine.py: This file contains a Value calss which could be seen as a simplification of Tensor class in pytorch
2. nn.py: This file code a MLP from scratch
3. test_engine.py: Test cases
4. Micrograd.md: A detailed explanation of every step of the implementation
